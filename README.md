# OpenNERO #

[OpenNERO](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?opennero) is an open source software platform designed for
research and education in Artificial Intelligence. The project is based on the
[Neuro-Evolving Robotic Operatives (NERO) game](http://www.nerogame.org/) developed by graduate
and undergraduate students at the  [Neural Networks Research Group](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/) and
[Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/) at the
[University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/).

In particular, OpenNERO has been used to implement several demos and exercises for Russell
and Norvig's textbook [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).  These
demos and exercises illustrate AI methods such as brute-force search, heuristic search, scripting,
reinforcement learning, and evolutionary computation, and AI problems such as maze running,
vacuuming, and robotic battle. The methods and problems are implemented in several different
environments (or "mods"), as described below.

More environments, problems, and methods, as well as demos and exercises illustrating them, will
be added in the future. The current ones are intended to serve as a starting point on which new
ones can be built, by us, but also by the community at large. If you have questions or would like to contribute, check out the [OpenNERO Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/opennero).
